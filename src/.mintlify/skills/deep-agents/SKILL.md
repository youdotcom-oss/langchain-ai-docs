# Deep Agents

Deep Agents is the easiest way to start building agents powered by LLMs—with built-in capabilities for task planning, file systems for context management, subagent delegation, and long-term memory. It is an "agent harness" built on [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/langchain/overview) core building blocks and the [LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/langgraph/overview) runtime.

## When to use

Use Deep Agents when you need to:
- **Build agents fast** with sensible defaults and minimal configuration
- **Handle complex, multi-step tasks** that benefit from automatic planning
- **Manage context** with a built-in virtual filesystem for large inputs
- **Delegate subtasks** to specialized subagents
- **Run code safely** in sandboxed execution environments
- **Use a terminal agent** via Deep Agents Code

## When NOT to use

- For simple tool-calling agents without planning or subagents, use [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/langchain/overview) agents instead—lighter weight
- For custom graph-based orchestration with explicit control flow, use [LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/langgraph/overview) directly
- Deep Agents is the **highest-level abstraction**—it trades flexibility for convenience

## Install

```bash
# Python
pip install deepagents

# JavaScript/TypeScript
npm install deepagents langchain @langchain/core
```

## Quick reference

### Create a deep agent

```python
# pip install deepagents langchain-anthropic
from deepagents import create_deep_agent

def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get weather for a given city."""
    return f"It's always sunny in {city}!"

agent = create_deep_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6",
    tools=[get_weather],
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant",
)

result = agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather in SF?"}]}
)
```

### Use Deep Agents Code

```bash
# Install Deep Agents Code
pip install deepagents-code

# Run an interactive terminal agent
deepagents
```

### Built-in capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Planning | Automatic task decomposition for complex requests |
| File system | Virtual filesystem for reading, writing, and managing context |
| Subagents | Spawn child agents for parallel subtask execution |
| Context management | Automatic context compression for long conversations |
| Sandboxed execution | Run code in isolated environments (Modal, Runloop, Daytona) |
| Protocols | ACP, MCP, and A2A support for interoperability |
