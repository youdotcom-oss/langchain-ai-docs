description: Gain control with LangGraph to design agents that reliably handle complex tasks
---

Trusted by companies shaping the future of agents-- including Klarna, Uber, J.P. Morgan, and more-- LangGraph is a low-level orchestration framework and runtime for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents.

LangGraph is very low-level, and focused entirely on agent **orchestration**. Before using LangGraph, we recommend you familiarize yourself with some of the components used to build agents, starting with [models](/oss/langchain/models) and [tools](/oss/langchain/tools).

We will commonly use [LangChain](/oss/langchain/overview) components throughout the documentation to integrate models and tools, but you don't need to use LangChain to use LangGraph. If you are just getting started with agents or want a higher-level abstraction, we recommend you use LangChain's [agents](/oss/langchain/agents) that provide prebuilt architectures for common LLM and tool-calling loops.

LangGraph is focused on the underlying capabilities important for agent orchestration: durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, and more.

<Tip>
  The [LangSmith Engine](/langsmith/engine) detects issues in your LangGraph agent traces and proposes fixes. You can open a pull request with the proposed fix directly from the Issues tab.

- [Deep Agents](/oss/deepagents/overview) is an [agent harness](/oss/concepts/products#agent-harnesses-like-the-deep-agents-sdk): planning, subagents, filesystem tools, and context management on top of LangGraph.
- [LangChain](/oss/langchain/overview) is the agent framework: abstractions and integrations for models, tools, and agent loops.
- [LangGraph](/oss/langgraph/overview) is the orchestration runtime: durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, and persistence.
- [LangSmith](/langsmith/home) is the platform for tracing, evaluation, prompts, and deployment across frameworks.
- [LangSmith Fleet](/langsmith/fleet/index) is the no-code agent builder for templates, integrations, and routine automation.

:::python
<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install -U langgraph
```

```bash uv

</CodeGroup>
:::

:::js
<CodeGroup>
```bash npm

Then, create a simple hello world example:

:::python
```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END

def mock_llm(state: MessagesState):
    return {"messages": [{"role": "ai", "content": "hello world"}]}

graph = StateGraph(MessagesState)
graph.add_node(mock_llm)
graph.add_edge(START, "mock_llm")
graph.add_edge("mock_llm", END)
graph = graph.compile()

graph.invoke({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi!"}]})
```
:::

:::js
```typescript
import { StateSchema, MessagesValue, GraphNode, StateGraph, START, END } from "@langchain/langgraph";

const State = new StateSchema({
  messages: MessagesValue,
});

const mockLlm: GraphNode<typeof State> = (state) => {
  return { messages: [{ role: "ai", content: "hello world" }] };
};

const graph = new StateGraph(State)
  .addNode("mock_llm", mockLlm)
  .addEdge(START, "mock_llm")
  .addEdge("mock_llm", END)
  .compile();

await graph.invoke({ messages: [{ role: "user", content: "hi!" }] });
```

<Tip>
Use [LangSmith](/langsmith/home) to trace requests, debug agent behavior, and evaluate outputs. Set `LANGSMITH_TRACING=true` and your API key to get started.

## Core benefits

LangGraph provides low-level supporting infrastructure for *any* long-running, stateful workflow or agent. LangGraph does not abstract prompts or architecture, and provides the following central benefits:

* [Durable execution](/oss/langgraph/durable-execution): Build agents that persist through failures and can run for extended periods, resuming from where they left off.
* [Human-in-the-loop](/oss/langgraph/interrupts): Incorporate human oversight by inspecting and modifying agent state at any point.
* [Comprehensive memory](/oss/concepts/memory): Create stateful agents with both short-term working memory for ongoing reasoning and long-term memory across sessions.
* [Debugging with LangSmith](/langsmith/home): Gain deep visibility into complex agent behavior with visualization tools that trace execution paths, capture state transitions, and provide detailed runtime metrics.
* [Production-ready deployment](/langsmith/deployment): Deploy sophisticated agent systems confidently with scalable infrastructure designed to handle the unique challenges of stateful, long-running workflows.

## LangGraph ecosystem

While LangGraph can be used standalone, it also integrates seamlessly with any LangChain product, giving developers a full suite of tools for building agents. To improve your LLM application development, pair LangGraph with:
